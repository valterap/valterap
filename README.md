## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Ph.D. student at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) in Portugal and I'm integrated into the [Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR-Lisbon)](https://isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).
My research interests focus on *computer vision*, *artificial intelligence*, and *robotics*. 
Particularly, my work focuses on **3D reconstruction** and **robust estimation methods**.
